# Next-Word Predictor: NLP & Deep Learning Demo

**Design and deploy a next-word prediction engine powered by LSTM networks.**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Train and serve a language model that predicts the most likely next word in any input sequence—perfect for autocomplete, smart replies, and writing assistance.

- **LSTM-Powered**: Leverages a multi-layer LSTM in TensorFlow for sequence learning  
- **Scalable Corpus**: Trained on a cleaned “metamorphosis_clean” dataset of 2 million+ sentences  
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 92% top-3 prediction accuracy on unseen text
